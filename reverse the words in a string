Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

//the big hint is to use stringstream


string reverseWords(string s) {
       stringstream ss(s);
        string word;
        stack<string> temp;
        while(ss>>word)
        {
            temp.push(word);
        }
        string res="";
        res+=temp.top();
        temp.pop();
        while(temp.size()!=0)
        {
            res+=" ";
            res+=temp.top();
            temp.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
